# FourierGame

by Daniel Yang, Xander Hirsch, Thomas Fleming 

This is a fun game to explore Fourier Analysis, in particular, the DFT.

This game was made for the HMC Math131 Capstone Project.

## Installation

1. Install [Python 3.8][python]. Do not use 3.9, since one of our
   dependencies does not support 3.9 yet. Make sure you have pip
   (the python package manager) installed.

2. Install the required dependencies with the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame argparse librosa numpy soundfile matplotlib scipy
    ```

3. Download an [archive of the game source code][code].

4. Extract the code on your computer.

5. In the folder where you extracted the code, run the following command:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```
